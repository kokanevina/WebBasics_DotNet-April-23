        <h3>Sachin Tendulkar</h3>
        <h2> About Sachin Tendulkar</h2>
        <section>      
You’ve heard the chant. You may not have heard of the sport, but you’ve heard the chant.
 The chant - one that a billion people once lived by; one that would originate from the Wankhede and echo across the city and the seas. It is a name that continues to inspire many, not only in India, but all over the world, to take up the sport. Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar was that cricketer whose personality and aura upstaged any cricketing contest; yet he maintained that he wasn’t greater than than the game. To the people of India, the 5’5” giant of a man was much more than that. He was an emotion; a symbol of hope in a nation that revered him as nothing short of a God.

Ironically, in the midst of the over-the-top veneration and in s
pite of the pedestal he has been placed on, it is his humility and the ability to cast it all out that has allowed him to put forth his best performances on the international stage for over two decades. Having played across generations, Tendulkar started playing Test cricket in a white shirt that could just as easily have been used as a school uniform, and scored his last Test hundred in a niche Nike jersey that was impossible to buy over the counter, and would later be auctioned for millions.
</section>
<h2>About his Family</h2>
<section>
In a nutshell


In the midst of all the constant adulation he has received over a significantly 
transitional period for cricket, commercially and otherwise, and in a 
sea of statistics that every Tendulkar-centric conversation attracts, it is sometimes easy to forget that he was perhaps the most complete batsman of his generation - one who combined natural talent with hard work and dedication; one who recognized the importance of shaping and polishing the diamond. This uncommon blend of dedication and ability made him stand out in the crowd, and made him the legend that is Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar.
</section>
<h2>About his career</h2>
<section>

Tendulkar has been the single biggest factor behind the explosion 
of popularity that cricket enjoys in India which led to the Indian 
board becoming the richest and most powerful in world cricket. In a 
country already predisposed to cricket, Tendulkar gave the people a hero they 
could look upto regardless of age, colour, creed or sect - and catapulted cricket 
from a sport to a religion in the subcontinent.

<h2 id="awards">About his Awards</h2>
<section >
The summit of all things cricket
In a game riddled with statistics, he owns almost every batting 
record worth owning, including that of the most runs in Test and ODI cricket, 
the most hundreds in the two formats, and the highest number of centuries in 
international cricket - a mind-numbing 100. Despite a tough start to his ODI career, 
Tendulkar found his calling at the top of the order when he was sent to open against 
New Zealand in 1994 and struck a 49-ball 82, and made the opening spot his own. He went on to compile 49 ODI hundreds by the end of his career - eclipsing the second-best by nineteen hundreds.
