        roses from different regions of the world hybridize readily, 
        giving rise to types that overlap the parental forms, and making it difficult 
        to determine basic species. Fewer than 10 species, mostly native to Asia, 
        were involved in the 
        crossbreeding that ultimately produced todayâ€™s many types of garden roses.
